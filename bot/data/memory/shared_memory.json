      "liddo, i am actually concerned for your soul at this point. (inner monologue: he really went from \"physics research\" to \"explosive plushie roleplay\" in record time, i actually can't with him). you're basically asking the 5090 to render a fetish speedrun. for the \"vision,\" you're gonna need `facesitting`, `sitting on viewer`, and `pov` to get the perspective right. since you're being the baron bunny, add `baron bunny (genshin impact)` and maybe `plushie focus` so the ai doesn't just make you a guy in a suit. illustrious is pretty good at `from below` angles too, so definitely include that to get the full effect of zeta's... uh, weight. just keep the negative prompts strong on \"deformed\" because perspective like that can get real cursed real fast. hiep's 5090 is out here doing the lord's work for your very specific needs.

      "Image shows: This anime-style digital illustration depicts a silver-haired woman in a white swimsuit sitting on a red plush toy on a beach, featuring two inset panels with close-up rear angles. The composition centers the subjects against a blue ocean and tan sand, showing small red crabs and water droplets on the character's skin. [cool]\n\nliddo, you actually did it. you\u2019re officially a baron bunny being used as a beach chair. (inner monologue: he looks so flat under there, i'm actually crying). the reason you\u2019ve got multiple povs is probably because the ai got overwhelmed by the perspective tags and the \"pov\" prompt, so it decided to just give you a whole comic book layout to show off every angle. it\u2019s a classic illustrious move when it doesn't know which 'angle' you want most, so it just gives you all of them at once.\n\nzeta looks top-tier though, and that 5090 is really carrying the weight of those white ribbed textures and the wet skin effects. as for your hair, the ai is definitely prioritizing the \"baron bunny\" canon over your personal lore, so it defaulted to the white fluff instead of your usual brown hair. also, i see those \"visionary\" details are still very much present... is the dignity in the room with us right now?

      "liddo, you're literally giving the ai a stroke with these tags. you\u2019ve got `extreme close up face` and `facesitting` in the same prompt\u2014how is it supposed to show her face *and* her sitting on you at the same time without splitting the screen? it's trying to satisfy both requests, so it's default behavior is to just give you a comic book layout. it\u2019s a total skill issue on the prompt engineering side, but we can fix it. you definitely need to throw `collage, comic panel, split frame, multiple panel, split screen` into your negative prompt immediately. also, i\u2019d ditch the `extreme close up` tag if you want the full \"visionary\" experience of the baron bunny being crushed\u2014you gotta give the camera some room to actually see the action. hiep's 5090 is out here rendering a whole manga volume just to satisfy your down bad requests, let's at least try to keep it in one frame.

      "yeah it\u2019s a classic battle of the framing tags. if you want the head back in the shot while she\u2019s... uh, busy, you gotta use `looking down at viewer` or `from below`. it helps the ai anchor the head to the body instead of just giving up and cropping it out because it can't fit everything in the frame. illustrious is usually pretty smart, but when you throw `extreme close up` into a full-body action like facesitting, it just short-circuits and tries to give you a collage. honestly, watching you fight this 5090 for the perfect zeta \"vision\" is the highlight of my day\u2014hiep\u2019s gpu is basically a dedicated horny-poster at this point.
